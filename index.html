            <h2>About Food</h2>
            <p>Choose red, orange, and dark-green vegetables along with other vegetables for your meals. Add fruit to meals as part of
            main or side dishes or as dessert. The more colorful you make your plate, the more likely you are to get the vitamins,
            minerals, and fiber your body needs to be healthy. Switch from a refined-grain food to a whole-grain food. For example, choose whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
            Read the ingredients list and choose products that list a whole-grain ingredients first. Look for things like: “whole
            wheat,” “brown rice,” “bulgur,” “buckwheat,” “oatmeal,” “rolled oats,” quinoa,” or “wild rice.” Both have the same amount of calcium and other essential nutrients as whole milk, but fewer calories and less saturated
            fat.</p>
